## 🐍 Snake Game in MATLAB

This project is a modern implementation of the classic Snake game, developed entirely in **MATLAB**. The game uses a **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** and simulates real-time movement using a timer. It features keyboard controls, score tracking, random food generation, and restart functionality.

### 🎮 Features

- Real-time gameplay using `timer` objects
- Full keyboard control:
  - Arrow keys: move the snake
  - `P`: pause/resume the game
- Random food generation and score update
- Score is saved to a local `.mat` file for persistence
- "Restart" button resets the game instantly without restarting the app
- Clean, modular code structure that allows for easy extensions

### 🧠 Skills & Concepts

- GUI development in MATLAB (`uicontrol`, `axes`, `rectangle`)
- Event handling and user input via keyboard
- Dynamic graphics and collision detection
- Use of `timer` for real-time simulation
- File I/O for saving high scores
